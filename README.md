## Description

<!-- Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project.
What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? What problem does it solve? What did you learn? -->

- In this project I created a full stack Tech blog site. I used MYSQL, Node.js, Handlebars, Sessions and Sequlize to make a site where users can login in and 
create, view, update and delete blog posts.

## Installation

<!-- What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running. -->

To install copy and paste either the SSH or HTTPS key and run it in either Bash (PC Users) or Terminal (MAC Users) using the git clone command.

- SSH key:

```md
git clone git@github.com:javierperez98/Tech_Blog.git
```

- HTTPS key:

```md
git clone https://github.com/javierperez98/Tech_Blog.git
```

Next you'll have to install all the required node modules by opening the index.js file using terminal/bash and typing in the following command.

```md
npm i
or
npm install
and then
npm start
```

## Usage

<!-- Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed. -->

- When you visit the site you are brought to the homepage where you can see all the posts created and the person and date they were created.
- To comment and create your own posts you have to create an account and login.
- Once logged in you are brought to your dashboard where you can create new posts and also edit or delete your posts.
- When logged in you can leave comments on other users posts.
- When logged in you now have the option to logout.
